description: Today, the science of management is big business, with leading gurus
  and consultants raking in billions of dollars each year. It's hard to believe that
  little more than a century ago, the concept of management as a separate discipline
  didn't even exist. Mechanical engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor almost single-handedly
  pioneered the field with the publication of this classic text. Managers or those
  in technical or industrial fields will find this to be fascinating reading.
